# Hi, I'm Liz 👋

I'm a **Head of Brand & Communications** with a strong background in **strategy, content, and digital presence**, and a **final-year Speech Therapy (Speech-Language Pathology) student** — currently completing my **last supervised practical training**.

I work at the intersection of **communication, design, and human-centered thinking**, combining creativity with structure and evidence-based approaches.

### Brand & Communications

- Content planning and storytelling  
- Visual identity and tone of voice  
- Digital communication systems (social media, campaigns, educational content)  
- Bridging strategy with execution  

### Speech Therapy (in practice)
